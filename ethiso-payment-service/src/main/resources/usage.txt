Usage:

PaymentService <rabbitHost> <routingKey> <gethRpc> <coinbasePassword> <restPort> <configPort> [ <configServiceUrl> ]

The PaymentService has two modes of operation.

The first mode, taking six arguments, designates this node as the primary node:

	* Upon startup the node will connect to rabbit at rabbitHost and listen on routingKey
	* It will also connect to geth over JSON RCP at the gethRpc (in host:port format)
	* It will create a coinbase account if neccessary (secured with the specified password) or unlock the account if it exists
	* Begin mining
	* Install the necessary contracts and store the Registrar address for when the process is restarted
	* Expose it's configuration by RPC on http://localhost:<configPort>/config
	
The second mode, taking seven arguments, designates this node as a secondary node:

	* Upon startup the node will connect to rabbit at rabbitHost and listen on routingKey
	* It will also connect to geth over JSON RCP at the gethRpc (in host:port format)
	* It will create a coinbase account if neccessary (secured with the specified password) or unlock the account if it exists
	* It will connect to the specified configServiceUrl and use it to configure itself
	* Wait to complete syncing and then begin mining
	* Compile the Registrar contract and attach to the same instance as the primary node
